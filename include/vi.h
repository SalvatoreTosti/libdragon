 * @brief Video Interface Subsystem
 * @ingroup display
 * 
 * This module offers a low-level interface to VI programming. Most applications
 * should use display.h, which sits on top of vi.h, and offers a higher level
 * interface, plus automatic memory management of multiple framebuffers,
 * FPS utilities, and much more.
 * 
 * ##Â Framebuffer resizing and video display size
 * 
 * VI has a powerful resampling engine: the framebuffer is not displayed as-is
 * on TV, but it is actually resampled (scaled, stretched), optionally with
 * bilinear filtering. This is a very powerful hardware feature that is a bit
 * complicated to configure, so an effort was made to expose an intuitive API
 * to programmers.
 *
 * By default, this module configures the VI to resample an arbitrary framebuffer
 * picture into a virtual 640x480 display output with 4:3 aspect ratio (on NTSC
 * and MPAL), or a virtual 640x576 display output though with the same 4:3
 * aspect ratio on PAL. This is done to achieve TV type independence: since
 * both resolution share the same aspect ratio on their respective TV standards
 * (given that dots are square on NTSC but they are not on PAL), it means
 * that the framebuffer will look the same on all TVs; on PAL, you will be
 * trading additional vertical resolution (assuming the framebuffer is big
 * enough to have that detail). 
 * 
 * This also means that games don't have to do anything special to handle NTSC
 * vs PAL (besides maybe accounting for the different refresh rate), which is
 * an important goal.
 * 
 * In reality, TVs didn't have a 480-lines vertical resolution so the actual
 * output depends on whether you request interlaced display or not:
 * 
 *  * In case of non interlaced display, the actual resolution is 640x240, but
 *    since dots will be configured to be twice as big vertically, the aspect
 *    ratio will be 4:3 as-if the image was 640x480 (with duplicated scanlines)
 *  * In case of interlaced display, you do get to display 480 scanlines, by
 *    alternating two slightly-shifted 640x240 pictures.
 * 
 * As an example, if you configure a framebuffer resolution like 512x320, with
 * interlacing turned off, what happens is that the image gets scaled into
 * 640x240, so horizontally some pixels will be duplicated to enlarge the
 * resolution to 640, but vertically some scanlines will be dropped. The
 * output display aspect ratio will still be 4:3, which is not the source aspect
 * ratio of the framebuffer (512 / 320 = 1.6666 = 16:10), so the image will
 * appear squished, unless obviously this was accounted for while drawing to
 * the framebuffer.
 * 
 * While resampling the framebuffer into the display output, the VI can use either
 * bilinear filtering or simple nearest sampling (duplicating or dropping pixels).
 * See #filter_options_t for more information on configuring
 * the VI image filters.
 * 
 * The 640x480 virtual display output can be fully viewed on emulators and on
 * modern screens (via grabbers, converters, etc.). When displaying on old
 * CRTs though, part of the display will be hidden because of the overscan.
 * To account for that, it is possible to reduce the 640x480 display output
 * by adding black borders. For instance, if you specify 12 dots of borders
 * on all the four edges, you will get a 616x456 display output, plus
 * the requested 12 dots of borders on all sides; the actual display output
 * will thus be smaller, and possibly get fully out of overscan. The value
 * #VI_CRT_MARGIN is a good default you can use for overscan compensation on
 * most CRT TVs.
 * 
 * Notice that adding borders also affect the aspect ratio of the display output;
 * for instance, in the above example, the 616x456 display output is not
 * exactly 4:3 anymore, but more like 4.05:3. By carefully calculating borders,
 * thus, it is possible to obtain specific display outputs with custom aspect
 * ratios (eg: 16:9).
 * 
 * To help calculating the borders by taking both potential goals into account
 * (overscan compensation and aspect ratio changes), you can use #vi_calc_borders.

/**
 * @brief Video Interface borders structure
 *
 * This structure defines how thick (in dots) should the borders around
 * a framebuffer be.
 * 
 * The dots refer to the VI virtual display output (640x480, on both NTSC, PAL,
 * and M-PAL), and thus reduce the actual display output, and even potentially
 * modify the aspect ratio. The framebuffer will be scaled to fit under them.
 * 
 * For example, when displaying on CRT TVs, one can add borders around a
 * framebuffer so that the whole image can be seen on the screen. 
 * 
 * If no borders are applied, the output will use the entire virtual dsplay
 * output (640x480) for showing a framebuffer. This is useful for emulators,
 * upscalers, and LCD TVs.
 * 
 * Notice that borders can also be *negative*: this obtains the effect of
 * actually enlarging the output, growing from 640x480. Doing so will very
 * likely create problems with most TV grabbers and upscalers, but it might
 * work correctly on most CRTs (though the added pixels will surely be
 * part of the overscan so not really visible). Horizontally, the maximum display
 * output will probably be ~700-ish on CRTs, after which the sync will be lost.
 * Vertically, any negative number will likely create immediate syncing problems,
